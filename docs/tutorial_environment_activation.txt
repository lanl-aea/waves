`SCons`_ and `WAVES`_ can be installed in a `Conda`_ environment with the `Conda`_ package manager. See the `Conda
installation`_ and `Conda environment management`_ documentation for more details about using `Conda`_.

.. note::

   The SALib and numpy versions may not need to be this strict for most tutorials. However,
   :ref:`tutorial_sensitivity_study` uncovered some undocumented SALib version sensitivity to numpy surrounding the
   numpy v2 rollout.

1. Create the tutorials environment if it doesn't exist

   .. code-block::

      $ conda create --name waves-tutorial-env --channel conda-forge waves 'scons>=4.6' matplotlib pandas pyyaml xarray seaborn 'numpy>=2' 'salib>=1.5.1' pytest

2. Activate the environment

   .. code-block::

      $ conda activate waves-tutorial-env

Some tutorials require additional third-party software that is not available for the `Conda`_ package manager. This
software must be installed separately and either made available to SConstruct by modifying your system's ``PATH`` or by
modifying the SConstruct search paths provided to the :meth:`waves.scons_extensions.add_program` method.
